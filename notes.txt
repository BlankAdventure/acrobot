in polling mode:
-> Even loop runs locally, polling telegram server for updates. Does not require running an http server.

in webhook mode:
-> A running http server is required to handle POST requests FROM the telegram server. Telegram must be provided with an https url to send requests too (this is the 'webhook address').


ngrok:
-> Provides an https address and forwards any traffic to your/a specified address 

python webhook.py -a 0.0.0.0 -p 10000 -w https://acrobot-t9k7.onrender.com

ngrok http 8443 <- sets up an http tunnel, directing traffic to port 8443. This is the port your server is listening for connections on.


# Set the webhook via the telegram API. 
curl -F "url=https://8068c65d68b6.ngrok-free.app" https://api.telegram.org/bot<api_key>/setWebhook


# Tell acrobot to run in webhook mode. The https address is obtained from running ngrok. The port numbers must match.
python runner.py webhook -w https://1bbf1c35bece.ngrok-free.app -p 8443

--------------------

-> Consider using protocols instead of ABC
-> Raise custom AcroError on acro generation failure (API call, *OR* quality)
-> *check that word contains alphabetic characters only*
Testing:
-> in Acrobot: commands ONLY 
-----> command_acro, handle_message -> only these need loop running
-> put fixtures into conftest.py

    try:

-> use inheritance
-> get rid of @catch
-> RECOMMEND using @dataclass, but not required -> need
